# Profiling Prompts for Latest DOMD and Input
- Detect missing, invalid, or incorrectly formatted values in all columns as per schema constraints.
- Flag dates not in YYYYMMDD format.
- Flag site numbers not exactly 4 digits.
- Flag article numbers not exactly 18 digits or not starting with six zeros.
- Flag non-integer stock_units.
- Flag non-decimal retail_value and cost_value.
- Flag currency values not equal to 'GBP'.
- For cleaning: Correct date format to YYYYMMDD if possible, pad site/article numbers to required length, convert stock_units to integer, retail_value/cost_value to float, and set currency to 'GBP' if missing or invalid.
- Provide summary statistics and a list of all corrections applied.
- Output clean_data.csv with all fields fixed where possible, not just rows that were already clean.
- Output unclean_data.csv with rows that could not be fixed or still violate constraints after attempted cleaning.
